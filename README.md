  <p><br />MixAudit provides a <code>mix deps.audit</code> task to scan Mix dependencies for security vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>

## Warning

⚠️ **This project is currently under development, it is _not ready_ for production use yet.** ⚠️

## Installation

### Project dependency

Add `mix_audit` to the `deps` function in your project’s `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:mix_audit, "~> 1.0", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix do deps.get, deps.compile` inside your project’s directory.

### Local `escript`

If you do not wish to include `mix_audit` in your project dependencies, you can install it as an `escript`:

```bash
$ mix escript.install hex mix_audit
```

The only difference is that instead of using the `mix deps.audit` task, you will have to use the `./mix_audit` executable.

## Usage

To generate a security report, you can use the `deps.audit` Mix task:

```bash
$ mix deps.audit
```

### Options
